ERROR 1 :
WARNING: Running pip as the 'root' user can result in broken permissions and conflicting behaviour with the system package manager. It is recommended to use a virtual environment instead: 



TRYING TO VIRTUAL ENVIRONMENTS FROM THE ABOVE LINK
STEP 1.1:
STATEMENT 1.1:
python3 -m venv tutorial-env
ERROR 1.1 :
The virtual environment was not created successfully because ensurepip is not available.  On Debian/Ubuntu systems, you need to install the python3-venv package using the following command.

apt-get install python3-venv

You may need to use sudo with that command.  After installing the python3-venv
package, recreate your virtual environment.

Failing command: ['/home/ailab/tutorial-env/bin/python3', '-Im', 'ensurepip', '--upgrade', '--default-pip']
